  âŽ¿ Plan: Optimize Google ADK Template for Simple Agentic Systems with MCP Tools

    Assessment: The current template is already highly suitable, but I can make targeted improvements to make it even more accessible for
    coding agents building simple agentic systems with MCP tools.

    Proposed Enhancements:

    1. Create a "Quick Start" MCP Example
      - Add examples/simple_mcp_agent/ with minimal boilerplate
      - Single file implementation showing basic MCP integration
      - Clear comments explaining each step
      - Environment setup script
    2. Simplify Documentation Structure
      - Create a "Simple Agent Development" guide in the main README
      - Add MCP-specific quick reference section
      - Include common MCP server configurations
    3. Add MCP Tool Templates
      - Template for connecting to common MCP servers
      - Examples for different MCP connection types (stdio, SSE)
      - Error handling patterns for MCP disconnections
    4. Create Development Utilities
      - Simple agent testing scripts
      - MCP connection validation tools
      - Environment verification checklist
    5. Improve Examples Organization
      - Add difficulty levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
      - Create cross-references between examples
      - Add "start here" guidance for MCP development
