# Research Analysis Workflow

This workflow demonstrates how to use Cognee MCP tools in Claude Code for research paper analysis and synthesis.

## Prerequisites

- Cognee MCP server running
- Neo4j database available (optional, but recommended)
- Research documents ready for processing

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Initial Document Processing

**You:** "Process the research papers in ./research_papers/ using the cognify tool"

**Claude will:**
- Use the `cognify` tool to process all documents in the specified directory
- Extract entities (researchers, concepts, methods, datasets)
- Build relationships between concepts
- Store embeddings in LanceDB for semantic search
- Create knowledge graph in Neo4j for relationship queries

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Processed 25 research papers
üìä Extracted 347 entities, 892 relationships
üíæ Stored 1,240 embeddings
‚è±Ô∏è  Processing time: 3.2 minutes
```

### 2. Explore Research Themes

**You:** "What are the main research themes in machine learning from these papers?"

**Claude will:**
- Use the `search` tool with vector similarity
- Identify clusters of related concepts
- Rank themes by frequency and centrality

**Expected Output:**
- Deep Learning (45% of papers)
- Reinforcement Learning (23% of papers)
- Natural Language Processing (31% of papers)
- Computer Vision (38% of papers)
- Transfer Learning (19% of papers)

### 3. Find Research Connections

**You:** "Show me connections between transformer architectures and computer vision applications"

**Claude will:**
- Use the `search` tool with graph traversal
- Find papers that bridge these domains
- Identify key researchers and breakthrough papers

**Expected Output:**
- Vision Transformer (ViT) papers by Dosovitskiy et al.
- DETR (Detection Transformer) work
- Swin Transformer architecture
- Cross-attention mechanisms in vision-language models

### 4. Researcher Network Analysis

**You:** "Map the collaboration network between AI researchers in this dataset"

**Claude will:**
- Query the knowledge graph for co-authorship relationships
- Identify research clusters and influential authors
- Show institutional connections

**Expected Output:**
- Network visualization of 127 researchers
- 15 major research clusters identified
- Top collaborators: Bengio-Goodfellow, Hinton-LeCun connections
- Cross-institutional collaborations mapped

### 5. Temporal Research Evolution

**You:** "Create a timeline showing how attention mechanisms evolved over time"

**Claude will:**
- Combine graph and vector search results
- Sort findings chronologically
- Identify breakthrough moments and incremental improvements

**Expected Output:**
```
2014: Bahdanau et al. - Neural Machine Translation attention
2015: Attention mechanisms in image captioning
2017: "Attention Is All You Need" - Transformer architecture
2018: BERT - Bidirectional attention
2019: GPT-2 - Scaled transformer attention
2020: GPT-3 - Massive scale attention models
2021: Vision Transformers - Attention in computer vision
```

## Advanced Queries

### Multi-hop Research Discovery

**You:** "Find papers that combine ideas from reinforcement learning and transformers for robotics applications"

This demonstrates complex graph traversal combining multiple domains.

### Comparative Analysis

**You:** "Compare the effectiveness claims of different attention mechanisms across papers"

This shows how to synthesize quantitative results from multiple sources.

### Gap Analysis

**You:** "What research gaps exist between theoretical advances and practical applications?"

This identifies areas where theory outpaces application or vice versa.

## Expected Database Usage

- **Neo4j**: Stores researcher networks, concept relationships, citation graphs
- **LanceDB**: Enables semantic similarity search across paper abstracts and content
- **SQLite**: Tracks processing status, paper metadata, search history

## Troubleshooting

**If no results found:**
- Verify documents were processed with `cognify` first
- Check that knowledge base contains data using `list_data` tool
- Try broader search terms initially

**If processing is slow:**
- Process documents in smaller batches
- Check database connection status
- Monitor system resources during large document processing

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Use specific terminology**: Research papers often use precise technical language
2. **Try different search strategies**: Vector for similarity, graph for relationships
3. **Build queries incrementally**: Start broad, then narrow down
4. **Leverage metadata**: Use publication years, author names, venues for filtering
5. **Cross-reference findings**: Combine multiple search results for comprehensive analysis

This workflow showcases the power of combining semantic search with graph relationships to understand complex research landscapes.
