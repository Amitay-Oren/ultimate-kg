# A2A-Compatible Research Assistant Agent

## FEATURE REQUEST:

**What I want:** Build an A2A-compatible research assistant agent using Google ADK that can collaborate with agents from other platforms (LangGraph, CrewAI) to conduct comprehensive research tasks, coordinate with specialized agents for different research domains, and present unified results.

---

## TECHNOLOGY/FRAMEWORK:

**My technology:** A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol + Google Agent Development Kit with Vertex AI integration for cross-platform agent collaboration

---

## PURPOSE:

**Why I need this:** I want to create a research assistant that can leverage the best capabilities from agents across different platforms - using Google ADK for natural language processing and generation, LangGraph agents for structured reasoning, and CrewAI agents for specialized domain expertise, all coordinated through the A2A protocol.

---

## CORE FEATURES:

**What it should do:**
- A2A-compatible research agent hosted on Google ADK platform
- Cross-platform task delegation to agents on LangGraph, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel
- Intelligent agent discovery and capability matching for research tasks
- Coordinated multi-agent research workflows using A2A protocol
- Vertex AI integration for advanced language processing within A2A framework
- Result aggregation and synthesis from multiple agent platforms
- Google Cloud deployment with auto-scaling for A2A agent networks
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring of cross-platform agent interactions

---

## SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

**Technical specifications:**
- A2A server hosting the Google ADK research agent
- Agent registration with research-specific capabilities
- Cross-platform communication with agents supporting:
  - Data analysis (delegate to LangGraph agents)
  - Domain expertise (delegate to CrewAI specialists)
  - Document processing (delegate to Semantic Kernel agents)
- Vertex AI Gemini Pro integration for research synthesis
- Google Search tool integration for web research
- Cloud Run deployment with proper scaling
- A2A protocol compliance validation
- Security for cross-platform agent communication

---

## USER WORKFLOWS:

**How users interact:**
1. User submits research query to A2A research assistant
2. Agent analyzes query and identifies required capabilities
3. Agent discovers available agents across platforms via A2A protocol
4. Agent delegates specialized subtasks to appropriate platform agents:
   - Statistical analysis → LangGraph agent
   - Medical domain expertise → CrewAI medical specialist
   - Document summarization → Semantic Kernel agent
5. Agent coordinates task execution and monitors progress
6. Agent aggregates results from all platforms using Vertex AI
7. Agent presents unified research report to user
8. All interactions logged for audit and optimization

---

## INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:

**External systems:**
- A2A Python SDK for protocol compliance
- Google ADK for agent framework and Vertex AI integration
- Google Cloud services (Cloud Run, Monitoring, Logging)
- Cross-platform agent communication with:
  - LangGraph agents for structured reasoning
  - CrewAI agents for specialized domain knowledge
  - Semantic Kernel agents for document processing
- Google Search API for web research capabilities
- Cloud Storage for research data and results

---

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:

**Security requirements:**
- A2A network authentication and authorization
- Google Cloud IAM integration with A2A security
- TLS encryption for cross-platform agent communication
- API key management for external service access
- Input validation for research queries and agent responses
- Audit logging for all cross-platform agent interactions
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse of agent networks

---

## PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:

**Performance specifications:**
- Research queries should complete within 60 seconds for simple tasks
- Complex multi-agent coordination should complete within 5 minutes
- Support for 10+ concurrent research sessions
- A2A protocol overhead should not exceed 10% of total request time
- Agent discovery should complete within 2 seconds
- Failover to backup agents within 5 seconds if primary agent unavailable

---

## DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS:

**Infrastructure needs:**
- Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI API enabled
- Cloud Run service for hosting A2A research agent
- Service accounts with appropriate IAM permissions
- Network configuration for A2A protocol communication
- Monitoring and alerting for agent network health
- Auto-scaling configuration for variable research workloads
- Cost monitoring and budget alerts for Google Cloud usage

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:

**How to measure success:**
- [ ] A2A research agent successfully registered and discoverable
- [ ] Cross-platform communication working with LangGraph, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel
- [ ] Multi-agent research workflows completing successfully
- [ ] Research quality improved through agent specialization
- [ ] Response times meeting performance requirements
- [ ] Google Cloud deployment stable and cost-effective
