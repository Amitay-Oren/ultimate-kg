# Document Analysis Workflow

This workflow shows how to analyze business documents, reports, and other text-heavy materials using Cognee MCP tools through Claude Code.

## Use Cases

- Business intelligence from reports
- Legal document analysis
- Technical documentation synthesis
- Content audit and organization
- Compliance document review

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Document Ingestion

**You:** "Use cognify to process all documents in ./business_docs/"

**What happens:**
- Documents are chunked and analyzed
- Key entities extracted (people, organizations, dates, financial figures)
- Relationships mapped between entities
- Content indexed for search

**Sample entities extracted:**
- Organizations: "Acme Corp", "Global Industries LLC"
- People: "Sarah Johnson, CEO", "Mike Chen, CFO"
- Financial: "$2.4M revenue", "15% growth"
- Dates: "Q3 2024", "fiscal year 2023"

### 2. Content Overview

**You:** "What types of documents are in the knowledge base?"

**Claude uses:** `list_data` tool

**Expected response:**
```
ðŸ“„ Document Summary:
- 45 financial reports (2020-2024)
- 23 meeting minutes
- 12 strategic planning documents
- 8 compliance reports
- 15 project proposals
- 7 market analysis reports
```

### 3. Entity Relationship Mapping

**You:** "Show me the organizational structure and key relationships from these documents"

**Claude uses:** `search` tool with graph queries

**Expected insights:**
- Executive team relationships
- Department interdependencies
- Vendor and partner connections
- Project team compositions
- Reporting hierarchies

### 4. Financial Trend Analysis

**You:** "Analyze financial performance trends mentioned across all reports"

**Claude uses:** Combined vector and graph search to find:
- Revenue patterns over time
- Cost structure changes
- Profitability metrics
- Investment allocations
- Market position indicators

### 5. Compliance and Risk Assessment

**You:** "Identify potential compliance issues or risks mentioned in the documents"

**Claude searches for:**
- Regulatory mentions
- Risk factors
- Compliance status updates
- Audit findings
- Legal concerns

### 6. Strategic Initiative Tracking

**You:** "Track the evolution of strategic initiatives across planning documents"

**Claude maps:**
- Initiative timelines
- Resource allocations
- Success metrics
- Dependencies between projects
- Strategic goal alignment

## Advanced Analysis Patterns

### Cross-Document Correlation

**You:** "Find contradictions or inconsistencies between different reports"

This helps identify:
- Data discrepancies
- Conflicting statements
- Version control issues
- Communication gaps

### Stakeholder Analysis

**You:** "Map stakeholder mentions and their roles across all documents"

Results in:
- Stakeholder influence mapping
- Communication frequency analysis
- Decision-making patterns
- Authority distribution

### Timeline Reconstruction

**You:** "Create a chronological timeline of major events and decisions"

Produces:
- Decision point timeline
- Cause-and-effect relationships
- Process evolution tracking
- Milestone achievement patterns

## Database Utilization

### Neo4j (Graph Database)
- Organizational hierarchies
- Document relationships
- Entity connections
- Process flows

### LanceDB (Vector Database)
- Semantic document similarity
- Content-based clustering
- Thematic analysis
- Duplicate detection

### SQLite (Metadata)
- Document processing status
- User search history
- Analysis timestamps
- Classification labels

## Quality Assurance Queries

### Data Validation

**You:** "Check for missing or incomplete information in financial reports"

### Accuracy Verification

**You:** "Cross-reference financial figures mentioned in different documents"

### Coverage Analysis

**You:** "What topics or areas have limited documentation?"

## Reporting and Insights

### Executive Summary Generation

**You:** "Generate an executive summary of key findings from the document analysis"

### Trend Reports

**You:** "Create a trends report showing changes over the last two years"

### Gap Analysis

**You:** "Identify information gaps that need additional documentation"

## Best Practices

1. **Document Preparation**
   - Ensure documents are in readable formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
   - Organize by category or time period before processing
   - Remove sensitive information if needed

2. **Processing Strategy**
   - Process documents in logical batches
   - Start with most recent or most important documents
   - Verify processing completion before analysis

3. **Query Formulation**
   - Use business terminology familiar to your organization
   - Start with broad queries, then narrow down
   - Combine different search approaches for comprehensive results

4. **Result Validation**
   - Cross-check important findings with source documents
   - Verify entity extraction accuracy
   - Confirm relationship mappings make business sense

## Troubleshooting

**Low-quality extractions:**
- Check document format and readability
- Verify text extraction worked properly
- Consider preprocessing documents for better structure

**Missing relationships:**
- Use more specific entity names
- Try different query phrasings
- Check if related documents were processed together

**Inconsistent results:**
- Verify document versions and dates
- Check for duplicate content
- Ensure complete document processing

This workflow demonstrates how Cognee MCP tools can transform document collections into queryable knowledge bases for business intelligence and analysis.
