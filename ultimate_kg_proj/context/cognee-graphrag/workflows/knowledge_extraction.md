# Knowledge Extraction Workflow

This workflow demonstrates advanced knowledge extraction and synthesis techniques using Cognee MCP tools in Claude Code.

## Objectives

- Extract structured knowledge from unstructured sources
- Build comprehensive knowledge graphs
- Enable intelligent knowledge discovery
- Support decision-making with synthesized insights

## Multi-Source Knowledge Integration

### 1. Diverse Content Processing

**You:** "Process knowledge from multiple sources: research papers in ./papers/, code repositories using codify on ./src/, and documentation in ./docs/"

**Sequential processing approach:**

```
Step 1: Research Literature
"Use cognify to process research papers in ./papers/"

Step 2: Code Analysis  
"Use codify to analyze the codebase in ./src/"

Step 3: Documentation Processing
"Use cognify to process documentation in ./docs/"
```

**Integrated knowledge result:**
- Theoretical concepts from papers
- Implementation patterns from code
- Best practices from documentation
- Cross-references between theory and practice

### 2. Knowledge Graph Construction

**You:** "Build a comprehensive knowledge graph connecting concepts across all processed sources"

**Claude integrates:**
- Academic concepts with practical implementations
- Theoretical frameworks with code patterns
- Documentation guidelines with actual usage
- Research findings with development practices

## Advanced Extraction Techniques

### 3. Concept Relationship Discovery

**You:** "Find implicit relationships between concepts that aren't explicitly stated in any single document"

**Example discoveries:**
- Algorithm X (from papers) → Implementation Pattern Y (from code) → Performance Guideline Z (from docs)
- Research Gap A → Potential Solution B (from different paper) → Existing Implementation C (from codebase)

### 4. Cross-Domain Knowledge Synthesis

**You:** "Identify how machine learning concepts from research papers apply to the software architecture patterns found in the codebase"

**Synthesis results:**
- Design patterns that support ML model deployment
- Code structure that enables experimental flexibility
- Architecture decisions influenced by algorithmic requirements
- Performance optimizations based on computational complexity

### 5. Knowledge Gap Analysis

**You:** "What knowledge gaps exist between our research understanding and practical implementation?"

**Gap identification:**
- Theoretical concepts without implementations
- Code patterns without documentation
- Documented approaches not found in research
- Research recommendations not reflected in code

## Specialized Extraction Patterns

### 6. Temporal Knowledge Evolution

**You:** "Track how understanding of specific concepts evolved across different document versions and time periods"

**Evolution tracking:**
- Concept definition changes over time
- Implementation approach improvements
- Documentation updates and refinements
- Research paradigm shifts

### 7. Authority and Credibility Mapping

**You:** "Map the credibility and authority of different knowledge sources for specific concepts"

**Authority indicators:**
- Citation frequency in research papers
- Adoption patterns in codebases
- Community consensus in documentation
- Expert authorship and peer review

### 8. Contextual Knowledge Application

**You:** "Show how the same concept applies differently across various contexts within our knowledge base"

**Context variations:**
- Algorithmic concept in theoretical vs. practical contexts
- Design pattern in different architectural layers
- Best practice in various development scenarios
- Performance consideration across different scales

## Knowledge Quality Assessment

### 9. Consistency Verification

**You:** "Check for inconsistencies or contradictions across different knowledge sources"

**Consistency checks:**
- Conflicting recommendations between sources
- Inconsistent terminology usage
- Contradictory performance claims
- Divergent implementation approaches

### 10. Completeness Analysis

**You:** "Assess the completeness of knowledge coverage for specific topics or domains"

**Completeness metrics:**
- Concept coverage depth
- Implementation completeness
- Documentation thoroughness
- Cross-reference density

## Advanced Query Patterns

### 11. Multi-Hop Reasoning

**You:** "Find connections that require multiple reasoning steps across different knowledge domains"

**Example multi-hop query:**
"How do distributed systems concepts from our architecture docs relate to the scalability challenges mentioned in ML research papers, and what solutions exist in our codebase?"

### 12. Analogical Reasoning

**You:** "Find analogies and similar patterns across different domains in the knowledge base"

**Pattern matching:**
- Similar algorithmic approaches in different contexts
- Analogous design patterns across system layers
- Parallel problem-solving strategies
- Comparable optimization techniques

### 13. Causal Relationship Discovery

**You:** "Identify cause-and-effect relationships that span multiple documents and knowledge domains"

**Causal chains:**
- Research insight → Design decision → Implementation choice → Performance outcome
- Problem identification → Solution research → Code implementation → Documentation update

## Knowledge Synthesis and Innovation

### 14. Novel Combination Discovery

**You:** "Identify potentially novel combinations of existing concepts that haven't been explicitly explored"

**Innovation opportunities:**
- Unexplored concept combinations
- Cross-domain application possibilities
- Integration opportunities between disparate ideas
- Synthesis potential for new approaches

### 15. Knowledge-Driven Recommendations

**You:** "Based on the complete knowledge graph, recommend improvements or new directions for our research and development"

**Recommendation categories:**
- Research directions with high implementation potential
- Code improvements based on theoretical insights
- Documentation enhancements for knowledge gaps
- Architecture optimizations from research findings

## Database Strategy for Knowledge Extraction

### Neo4j Usage
- Complex relationship modeling
- Multi-hop graph traversals
- Pattern matching across domains

## Validation and Quality Control

### 16. Expert Review Integration

**You:** "Highlight knowledge extractions that should be reviewed by domain experts"

**Review criteria:**
- High-impact insights
- Contradictory findings
- Novel discoveries
- Cross-domain connections

### 17. Confidence Scoring

**You:** "Provide confidence scores for different knowledge extractions based on source quality and consistency"

**Scoring factors:**
