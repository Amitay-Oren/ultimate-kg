# Generate A2A-Google ADK PRP

## Feature file: $ARGUMENTS

Generate a comprehensive PRP for building A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol compatible AI agents using Google's Agent Development Kit. This follows the A2A-Google ADK PRP framework workflow: INITIAL.md → generate-a2a-google-adk-prp → execute-a2a-google-adk-prp.

**CRITICAL: Focus on A2A protocol compliance and cross-platform interoperability with Google ADK integration.**

## Research Process

1. **Read and Understand A2A-Google ADK Requirements**
   - Read the specified INITIAL.md file thoroughly
   - Understand A2A protocol compliance requirements
   - Note cross-platform agent coordination needs
   - Identify Google ADK integration patterns required
   - Understand the scope of A2A-compatible agent development

2. **A2A Protocol Research (CRITICAL)**
   - **Web search A2A protocol specifications and patterns**
   - Study A2A Python SDK documentation and examples
   - Research cross-platform agent communication patterns
   - Find A2A server setup and deployment examples
   - Identify A2A compliance validation requirements
   - Look for A2A security and authentication patterns

3. **Google ADK Integration Analysis**
   - Research Google ADK patterns within A2A framework
   - Study Vertex AI integration for A2A-compatible agents
   - Examine Google Cloud deployment patterns for A2A servers
   - Find Google ADK tool integration with A2A capabilities
   - Identify authentication bridging between Google Cloud and A2A

4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility Planning**
   - Map A2A protocol requirements to Google ADK capabilities
   - Plan agent discovery and registration mechanisms
   - Design task delegation patterns between different platforms
   - Plan A2A network security with Google Cloud integration
   - Design validation frameworks for cross-platform testing

## PRP Generation

Using PRPs/templates/prp_a2a_google_adk_base.md as the foundation:

### Critical A2A Context to Include

**A2A Protocol Documentation**:
- A2A protocol specifications and compliance requirements
- A2A Python SDK installation and setup procedures
- Cross-platform agent communication patterns
- A2A server architecture and deployment patterns
- Agent discovery and capability advertisement mechanisms

**Google ADK Integration Patterns**:
- Vertex AI model integration within A2A framework
- Google ADK tool registration in A2A capabilities
- Google Cloud authentication with A2A protocol
- Cloud Run deployment patterns for A2A agents
- Google Cloud monitoring for A2A agent networks

**Cross-Platform Coordination**:
- Task delegation between Google ADK and other platform agents
- Multi-agent workflow orchestration using A2A protocol
- Agent network security and trust management
- Performance optimization for A2A protocol overhead
- Error handling and resilience in cross-platform scenarios

### Implementation Blueprint

Based on A2A-Google ADK research findings:
- **A2A Compliance Analysis**: Document A2A protocol requirements and validation
- **Google Integration Strategy**: How to integrate Google ADK with A2A protocol
- **Cross-Platform Architecture**: Plan agent coordination across different platforms
- **Security Framework**: A2A network security with Google Cloud integration
- **Validation Design**: A2A compliance testing and cross-platform validation

### Validation Gates (Must be Executable)

```bash
# A2A Protocol Compliance Validation
python -c "import a2a_sdk; print('A2A SDK available')"
a2a-validator --help  # Verify A2A validation tools available

# Google ADK Integration Testing
python -c "from google.cloud import aiplatform; print('Google ADK integration OK')"
gcloud auth application-default print-access-token

# A2A Server Setup Validation
python config/a2a_server_config.py --validate
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/health  # Test A2A server health

# Cross-Platform Agent Testing
python examples/cross_platform_delegation/test_delegation.py
pytest tests/a2a_compliance/ -v
```

*** CRITICAL: Research A2A protocol thoroughly and understand cross-platform requirements ***
*** Focus on Google ADK integration patterns within A2A framework ***
