# Google ADK Agent System - Initial Requirements

## AGENT SYSTEM:

**Your agent system:** Customer Support Intelligence System using Google Agent Development Kit

---

## AGENT PURPOSE:

**Your purpose:** Build an intelligent multi-agent customer support system using Google's Agent Development Kit that can handle customer inquiries, access account information, coordinate between specialized support agents, and escalate complex issues appropriately. The system should deploy to Google Cloud and scale automatically based on demand.

---

## CORE AGENT CAPABILITIES:

**Your core capabilities:**
- Multi-agent coordination with specialized roles (triage, technical support, billing, escalation)
- Customer authentication and account data access
- Intelligent inquiry classification and routing
- Knowledge base search and information retrieval
- Automated ticket creation and management
- Escalation workflows to human agents
- Real-time sentiment analysis and priority adjustment
- Multi-turn conversation handling with context preservation
- Integration with CRM and ticketing systems
- Google Cloud deployment with auto-scaling
- Cost optimization and usage monitoring

---

## AGENT EXAMPLES TO INCLUDE:

**Your agent examples:**
- Triage agent that classifies incoming support requests
- Technical support agent with troubleshooting capabilities
- Billing agent with account access and payment processing
- Escalation coordinator that routes complex issues to humans
- Knowledge base search agent with information synthesis
- Multi-agent coordinator that orchestrates the entire system
- Sentiment analysis agent for priority adjustment
- Google Cloud Run deployment example
- Vertex AI Agent Engine integration example
- Cost monitoring and optimization example

---

- Multi-agent system coordination and state management
- Google Cloud authentication and IAM configuration

---

## AGENT DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS:

**Your development patterns:**
- Multi-agent system architecture with clear agent specialization
- Hierarchical coordination with parent coordinator and specialized sub-agents
- Tool integration patterns for external system access (CRM, knowledge base)
- State management and context sharing across agent interactions
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms for agent failures
- Google Cloud service integration (Vertex AI, Cloud Storage, Cloud Run)
- Environment-based configuration for development vs production
- Comprehensive testing strategies for multi-agent behavior
- Cost optimization patterns for production deployment
- Monitoring and logging for agent system observability

---

## SECURITY & BEST PRACTICES:

**Your security considerations:**
- Google Cloud IAM and service account management for agent authentication
- Customer data privacy and access control patterns
- Input validation and sanitization for customer inquiries
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention for agent interactions
- Cost controls and budget monitoring for model usage
- Audit logging for customer interactions and agent decisions
- Secure integration with external CRM and ticketing systems
- Data encryption for sensitive customer information
- Compliance considerations for customer service operations
- Multi-tenant security for different customer organizations

---

## COMMON GOTCHAS:

**Your gotchas:**
- Multi-agent coordination complexity leading to infinite loops or conflicts
- Context management across multiple agent interactions and handoffs
- Error cascading when one agent failure affects the entire system
- Google Cloud regional model availability and latency considerations
- Cost accumulation from multiple agents making concurrent model calls
- Customer authentication and session management across agent handoffs
- External system integration failures (CRM, knowledge base unavailable)
- Agent response consistency when multiple agents handle the same customer
- Debugging complex multi-agent workflows and interaction patterns
- Performance optimization for high-volume customer support scenarios

---

## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:

**Your validation requirements:**
- Multi-agent coordination testing with mock customer scenarios
- Individual agent capability testing with specific support scenarios
- Error handling validation for agent failures and external system outages
- Google Cloud deployment and auto-scaling validation
- Customer authentication and data access security testing
- Cost monitoring and budget control validation
- Integration testing with external systems (CRM, knowledge base)
- Performance testing for high-volume customer support scenarios
- Escalation workflow testing with human agent handoff
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring validation

---

## INTEGRATION FOCUS:

**Your integration focus:**
- CRM systems (Salesforce, HubSpot) for customer data access
- Ticketing systems (Zendesk, Jira Service Desk) for case management
- Knowledge base systems for information retrieval and synthesis
- Payment processing systems for billing-related inquiries
- Communication platforms (Slack, Teams) for agent notifications
- Google Cloud services (Vertex AI, Cloud Storage, Cloud Monitoring)
- Authentication providers for customer identity verification
- Analytics platforms for customer interaction insights
- Notification systems for escalation alerts
- Database systems for conversation history and context storage

---

## ADDITIONAL NOTES:

**Your additional notes:**
- Focus on Google Cloud native deployment and auto-scaling capabilities
- Emphasize multi-agent coordination patterns and best practices
- Include comprehensive cost optimization strategies for production use
- Provide clear escalation paths to human agents for complex issues
- Design for high availability and fault tolerance in production
- Include comprehensive monitoring and alerting for system health
- Focus on customer experience optimization and response time minimization
- Provide flexible configuration for different customer support scenarios

---

## AGENT COMPLEXITY LEVEL:

**Your choice:**
- [x] **Advanced** - Comprehensive multi-agent patterns with complex coordination
- [x] **Enterprise** - Full enterprise patterns with monitoring, scaling, security

**Explanation:** This customer support agent system should target advanced developers building enterprise-grade solutions. It needs sophisticated multi-agent coordination, comprehensive Google Cloud integration, and production-ready patterns for high-volume customer support operations.
